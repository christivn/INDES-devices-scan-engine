# INDES
<h2>üåê IPV4 Internet Connected Devices Scan Engine<br></h2>

<p><b>INDES</b> is able to analyze all the open ports of a device connected to the Internet and record the services it offers, the operating system it uses or the headers. The data is stored in a <b>mysql database</b>, it has ease of implementation in other tools, and the possibility of being configured in a <b>decentralized</b> way.</p>
      
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><h2>Mode: CLI</h2>
The CLI mode allows you to use the basic options from any terminal on any operating system (Linux, Windows, Mac).
It is the best option, since it can run several processes at the same time on different terminal screens.</td>

## üì¢ How does it work
The search engine uses the library [subnet-calculator-cidr](https://github.com/christivn/subnet-calculator-cidr) and [geoipgen](https://github.com/christivn/geoipgen) to generate IP ranges according to country, for targeted attacks. Then it goes through the whole range getting the data through [NMAP](https://github.com/nmap/nmap) and saves the data in a DB with MYSQL.
